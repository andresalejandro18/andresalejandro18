# &iexcl;Hola! Welcome to my Profile!

## About Me
My name is AndrÃ©s Alejandro Davila Vargas and I am from Miami, Florida. I come from a Colombian-Venezuelan background, with Barranquilla, Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ and Caracas, Venezuela ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡ª regarded as my other home cities. I graduated from Florida International University with a Bachelor of Science in Economics and a minor in Computer Science and am currently an incoming master's student at [To Be Determined] where I'll study Data Science on the [To Be Determined].

## Research Interests
Although my background is in economics and computer science, I developed an interest in bioinformatics and health data science thanks to working as a Life Sciences Research Scholar at Charles River Associates under the [American Economic Association Summer Program](https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/committees/aeasp) in 2023. Under Professor Jose F. Rodriguez's seminar, "Treat the Person, Not Only the Disease", I did a literature review on "high functioning addiction" and how social media impacts the way adolescents and young adults view substance abuse and addiction. With that, my interests align with genetic predispositions and molecular mechanisms of substance abuse disorders and developing efficient treatment plans to combat those disorders for affected individuals.

## At the Moment...
I am working as a Epidemiology Research Assistant at the Frost Institute for Data Science & Computing at University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, under the [Population Health Informatics Department](https://idsc.miami.edu/research/digital-health/population-health-informatics/). In addition, I am part of FIU's [Office of Analysis and Information Management](https://opir.fiu.edu) as a Data Analyst I for Curriculum Planning.
